Every time you record a transaction or piece of data, it's bundled into a 'block' that carries a unique cryptographic fingerprint called a hash calculated from its own contents and the hash of the previous block. Before that block can be added the network's computers use a consensus process (like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake) to verify that all its transactions are valid. Once everyone agrees and the block is sealed in, altering its data would break the cryptographic links forward, so any tampering is instantly obvious.Because thousands of independent nodes each hold an identical copy of the chain and follow the same rules, there is no single point of control or failure—and no need for a middleman. This decentralized setup, combined with transparent verification and immutable records, gives you a secure, self-auditing system that anyone on the network can trust."]
